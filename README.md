Hi, I'm JHC!

I'm only a teenager and therefor not as experienced as a professional (OBVIOUSLY), yet I'd argue that I am quite competent/experienced for my age. I have been coding for many years. In some languages I may have more experience than in others, but I think I have developed a quite good understanding of coding in general, as well as specific concepts in specific languages. - Please make your own opinion on how good I am by reviewing some projects of mine! (I haven't uploaded anything by the time I write this, but maybe you can find something now!)

Here are some coding languages I code/coded in:
- Arduino
- Javascript, HTML, CSS
- Python
- Brainfuck (that's the one with just <>+-[],.)
- Pascal
- Scratch 2 (I started with Scratch when I was about 10, I think, which helped me understand the general basic concepts of coding.)

Please take a look around!

\- JHC :)
